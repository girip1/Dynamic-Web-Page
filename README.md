# Dynamic-Web-Page
This project is created by using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript code to implement a dynamic web site. If a title is clicked, the webpage figure will be changed. For example, if you click the “home” title, a figure with “Escape” and “explore nature” will appear. If a title “explore” title is clicked, the main menu webpage with “Jungle”, “Mountains”, “Desert” and other titles will appear. If you click any other title, the corresponding figure will appear.
